# Countdown Champ

This React app displays a specific date as well as a Days/Hours/Minutes/Seconds countdown timer.
The date is set by default to New Year's Day, 2019 but is changeable by entering a new date in the input field
and pressing the submit button. The countdown timer will then change in response to the new date. This project
was utilized to learn React and is from the **React JS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps** course on Udemy.

## Resources and Credits

This application is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The idea for this application came from the [React JS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps](https://www.udemy.com/react-js-and-redux-mastering-web-apps)
course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). I then further customized the application to include error handling,
documentation, and a unique CSS style.
